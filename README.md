## Javadoc Comment Generator
This is a small extension that I made to automatically generate javadoc comments for methods(and eventually variables) based on user input.
# Features
Uses method headers of javadoc comments to write comments based on what the user wants. Will improve this in the future.
# Requirements
VSCode needs a Java language extension such as Red Hat's Java language support(recommended).
# Installation
Download as an extension on vscode.
# Releases
Coming Soon!
